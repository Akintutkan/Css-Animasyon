<p>Located deep in Siberia, the village of Oymyakon holds the title of the coldest permanently inhabited place on Earth, tied with Verkhoyansk.

<p>From December to February, the weather in the tiny village (population 500) plummets to  -50°F (-45C), with a record low of -90°F (-68C) registered in 1933. At those temperatures, a naked human left outside would freeze to death in under a minute.

<p>The extreme conditions are partly due to the fact that the hamlet lies between two large ranges that trap arctic air between them; it is actually significantly warmer on the mountains than in the valley below.

<p>Surprisingly, summers in Oymyakon can be very mild, even hot; the town is also a growing tourist destination.
